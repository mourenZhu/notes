What is the special importance of a telescope in space?

The Hubble telescope was launched into space by NASA on April 20, 1990 at a cost of over a billion dollars. Right from the start there was trouble with the Hubble. The pictures it sent us were very disappointing because its main mirror was faulty! NASA is now going to put the telescope right, so it will soon be sending up four astronauts to repair it. The shuttle _Endeavour_ will be taking the astronauts to the Hubble. A robot-arm from the _Endeavour_ will grab the telescope and hold it while the astronauts make the necessary repairs. Of course, the Hubble is above the earth's atmosphere, so it will soon be sending us the clearest pictures of the stars and distant galaxies that we have ever seen. The Hubble will tell us a great deal about the age and size of the universe. By the time you read this, the Hubble's eagle ete will have sent us thousands and thousands of wonderful pictures.

# Lesson 62 After the fire

What was the danger to the villages after the fire?

Firemen had been fighting the forest fire for nearly three weeks before they could get it under control. A short time before, great trees had covered the countryside for miles around. Now, smoke still rose up from the warm ground over the desolate hills. Winter was coming on and the hill threatened the surrounding villages with destruction, for heavy rain would not only wash away the soil but would cause serious floods as well. When the fire had at last been put out, the forest authorities ordered several tons of a special type of grass-seed which would grow quickly. The seed was sprayed over the ground in huge quantities by airplanes. The planes had been planting seed for nearly a month when it began to rain. By then, however, in many places the grass had already taken root. In place of the great trees which had been growing there for centuries, patches of green had begun to appear in the blackened soil.

## Key Structure

- 过去完成时
    - 形式：had done
    - 用法：过去的之前，强调事情完成的结果
- 过去完成进行时
    - 形式：had been doing
    - 用法：过去的之前，强调事情进行的过程

|两种时态|过去完成时 had done | 过去完成进行时 had been doing |
|-------|-------------------|------------------------------|
|角度相同|“过去的之前”|“过去的之前”|
|强调不同|强调完成的结果(做完与否都可以)|强调持续进行的过程|
|例句|Firemen __had put__ out the fire.|Firemen __had been fighting__ the fire for three weeks.|

- great vs. big
    - great 还包含重要性
    - 仅表示大

- 复习表示过去的时态
    - 一般过去时 did
    - 过去进行时 was/were doing 进行
    - 过去将来时 would do 之后
    - 过去完成时 had done 之前 + 结果
    - 过去完成进行时 had been doing 之前 + 过程
