When was the last time this country hosted the Olympic Games?

The Olympic Games will be held in our country in four years' time. As a great many people will be visiting the country, the government will be building new hotels, an immense stadium, and a new Olympic-standard swimming pool. The will also be building new roads and a special railway line. The Games will be held just outside the capital and the whole area will be called 'Olympic City'. Workers will have completed the new roads by the end of this year. By the end of next year, they will have finished work on the new stadium.

Why did Harrison sell his house so quickly?

My old friend, Harrison, had lived in the Mediterranean for many years before he returned to England. He had often dreamed of retiring in England and had planned to settle down in the country. He had no sooner returned than he bought a house and went to live there. Almost immediately he began to complain about the weather, for even though it was still summer, it rained continually and it was often bitterly cold. After so many years of sunshine, Harrison got a shock. He acted as if he had never lived in England before. In the end, it was more than he could bear. He had hardly had time to settle down when he sold the house and left the country. The dream he had had for so many years ended there. Harrison had thought of everything except the weather.

Was Mrs.Rumbold a good companion at dinner?

Last week at a dinner party, the hostess asked me to sit next to Mrs.Rumbold. Mrs.Rumbold was a large, unsmiling lady in a tight black dress. She did not even look up when I took my seat beside her.  Her eyes were fixed on her plate and in a short time, she was busy eating. I tried to make conversation.  
'A new play is coming to "The Globe" soon,' I said. 'Will you be seeing it?'  
'No,' she answered.  
'Will you be spending your holidays abroad this year?' I asked.  
'No,' she answered.  
'Will you be staying in England?' I asked.  
'No,' she answered.  
In despair, I asked her whether she was enjoying her dinner.  
'Young man,' she answered, 'if you ate more and talked less, we would both enjoy our dinner!'
