How long has Mr.Page been teaching?

I have just received a letter from my old school, informing me that my former headmaster, Mr.Stuart Page, will be retiring next week. Pupils of the school, old and new, will be sending him a present to mark the occasion. All those __who have contributed towards the gift__ will sign their names in a large album __which will be sent to the headmaster's home__. We shall all remember Mr.Page for his patience and understanding and for the kindly encouragement he gave us when we went so unwillingly to school. A great many former pupils will be attending a farewell dinner in his honour next Thursday. It is a curious coincidence that the day before his retirement, Mr.Page will have been teaching for a total of forty years. After he has retired, he will devote himself to gardening. For him, this will be an entirely new hobby. But this does not matter, for, as he has often remarked, one is never too old to learn.

What was the danger?

As the man tried to swing the speedboat round, the steering wheel came away in his hands. He waved desperately to his companion, who had been water skiing for the last fifteen minutes. Both men had hardly had time to realize what was happening when they were thrown violently into the sea. The speedboat had struck a buoy, but it continued to move very quickly across the water. Both men had just begun to swim towards the shore, when they noticed with dismay that the speedboat was moving in a circle. It now came straight towards them at tremendous speed. In less than a minute, it roared past them only a few feet away. After it had passed, they swam on as quickly as they could because they knew that the boat would soon return. They had just had enough time to swim out of danger when the boat again completed a circle. On this occasion, however, it had slowed down considerably. The petrol had nearly all been used up. Before long, the noise dropped completely and the boat began to drift gently across the water.

What was wrong with the man's story?

'At the time the murder was committed, I was travelling on the 8 o'clock train to London,' said the man.  
'Do you always catch such an early train?' asked the inspector.  
'Of course I do,' answered the man. 'I must be at work at 10 o'clock. My employer will confirm that I was there on time.'  
'Would a later train get you to work on time?' asked the inspector.  
'I suppose it would, but I never catch a later train.'  
'At what time did you arrive at the station?'  
'At ten to eight. I bought a paper and waited for the train.'  
'And you didn't notice anything unusual?'  
'Of course not.'  
'I suggest,' said the inspector, 'that you are not telling the truth. I suggest __that you did not catch the 8 o'clock train__, but __that you caught the 8.25 which would still get you to work on time__. You see, on the morning of the murder, the 8 o'clock train did not run at all. It broke down at Ferngreen station and was taken off the line.'
