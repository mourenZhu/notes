# Lesson 1 A private conversation

## text
    Wyh did writer complain the people behind him?
    
    Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They talking loudly. I got very angry. I could hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not hear it. I turned round again. 'I can't hear a word!'I said angrily.
      'It's none of your business,'the young man said rudely.'This is a private conversation!'
