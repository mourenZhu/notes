When will the writer see the play?

'The play may begin at any moment,' I said.  
'It may have begun already,' Susan answered.  
I hurried to the ticket office. 'May I have two tickets please?' I asked.  
'I'm sorry, we've sold out,' the girl said.  
'What a pity!' Susan exclaimed.  
Just then, a man hurried to the ticket office.  
'Can I return these two tickets?' He asked.  
'Certainly,' the girl said.  
I went back to the ticket office at once.  
'Could I have those two tickets please?' I asked.  
'Certainly,' the girl said, 'but they're for next Wednesday's performance. Do you still want them?'  
'I might as well have them,' I said sadly.
