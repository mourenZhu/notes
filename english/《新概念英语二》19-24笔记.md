## text

When will the writer see the play?

'The play may begin at any moment,' I said.  
'It may have begun already,' Susan answered.  
I hurried to the ticket office. 'May I have two tickets please?' I asked.  
'I'm sorry, we've sold out,' the girl said.  
'What a pity!' Susan exclaimed.  
Just then, a man hurried to the ticket office.  
'Can I return these two tickets?' He asked.  
'Certainly,' the girl said.  
I went back to the ticket office at once.  
'Could I have those two tickets please?' I asked.  
'Certainly,' the girl said, 'but they're for next Wednesday's performance. Do you still want them?'  
'I might as well have them,' I said sadly.

Why is fishing the writer's favorite sport?

Fishing is my favorite sport. I often fish for hours without catching anything. But this does not worry me. Some fishermen are unlucky. Instead of catching fish, they catch old boots and rubbish. I am even less lucky. I never catch anything - not even old boots. After having spent whole morning on the river, I always go home with an empty bag. 'You must give up fishing!' my friends say. 'It's a waste of time.' But they don't realize one important thing. I'm not really interested in fishing. I am only interested in sitting in a boat and doing nothing at all.

## text
{% meting "28258333" "netease" "song" %}

Why do people think the writer is mad?

Airplanes are slowly driving me mad. I live near an airport and passing planes can be heard night and day. The airport was built years ago, but for some reason it could not be used then. Last year, however, it came into use. Over a hundred people must have been driven away from their homes by the noise. I am one of few people left. Sometimes I think this house will be knocked down by a passing plane. I have been offered a large sun of money to go away, but I am determined to stay here. Everybody says I must be mad  and they are probably right.
