Why does Tazieff risk his life like this?

Haroun Tazieff, the Polish scientist, has spent his lifetime studying active volcanoes and deep caves in all parts of the world. In 1948, he went to Lake Kivu in the Congo to observe a new volcano which he later named Kituro. Tazieff was able to set up his camp very close to the volcano while it was erupting violently. Though he managed to take a number of brilliant photographs, he could not stay near the volcano for very long. He noticed that a river of liquid rock was coming towards him. It threatened to surround him completely, but Tazieff managed to escape just in time. He waited until the volcano became quiet and he was able to return two days later. This time, he managed to climb into the mouth of Kituro so that he could take photographs and measure temperatures. Tazieff has often risked his life in this way. He has been able to tell us more about active volcanoes than any man alive.

# Lesson 68 Persistent

Why did Elizabeth tell Nigel that she was going to the dentist?

I crossed the street to avoid meeting him, but he saw me and came running towards me. It was no use pretending that I had not seen him, so I waved to him. I never enjoy meeting Nigel Dykes. He never has anything to do. No matter how busy you are, he always insists on coming with you. I had to think of a way of preventing him from following me around all morning.  
'Hello, Nigel,' I said. 'Fancy meeting you here!'  
'Hi, Elizabeth,' Nigel answered. 'I was just wondering how to spend the morning - until saw you. You're not busy doing anything, are you?'  
'No, not at all,' I answered. 'I'm going to ...'  
'Would you mind my coming with you?' he asked, before I had finished speaking.  
'Not at all,' I lied, 'but I'm going to the dentist.'  
'Then I'll come with you,' he answered. 'There's always plenty to read in the waiting room!'
